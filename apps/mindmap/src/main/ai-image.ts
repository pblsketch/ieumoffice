/**
 * Image search/generation for the mind map's AI panel: the two channels the
 * renderer calls to bring a picture into the map file.
 *
 * The bytes are the renderer's business (it puts them into the document as a
 * new entry); this side only reaches the network. `generateImageTool` is the
 * same tool the other editors use, with the statuses of the process-wide
 * subscription service, and `fetchImageBytes` reads a web address or the file
 * the generator wrote into its own store — the generated-image store is the
 * only `file://` it answers.
 *
 * The channels are this editor's own (`mindmap:`); the shared `ai:*` and
 * subscription channels belong to the docs main and are never registered here.
