# Writing a Hangul document

For a document written **from scratch** (or a large new part of one). Filling in a form that is already there needs no skill: read the table and fill it. When the user asks for the Ministry of the Interior and Safety report format (행안부 형식), use `administration-report-draft` instead.

The tool names below are those of the Hangul editor's AI panel. In another window, do the same steps with the tools that window gives you.

## 1. Settle four things first

Take them from the request and the attachments. Ask only for what is missing and matters, in one question; otherwise choose a sensible default and say in your reply what you assumed.

| Decide | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Kind of document | Fixes the parts and their order (section 2) |
| Reader | Inside the organisation → terse items (개조식). Outside it (residents, customers, members) → full polite sentences (서술식) |
| Length | One page is the default for a notice or a report to a superior. Go longer only when the material needs it |
| Material | The facts, dates, names and figures to use. Nothing else may appear as a fact |

## 2. Lay out the parts

| Kind | Parts, in order |
| --- | --- |
| 보고서 (report) | 제목 → 개요(목적·배경) → 현황 및 문제점 → 추진 내용 또는 분석 → 향후 계획 → 붙임 |
| 계획서 (plan) | 제목 → 목적 → 방침 → 세부 추진 계획(일정·담당은 표) → 소요 예산(표) → 기대 효과 → 행정 사항 |
| 안내문 (notice) | 제목 → 인사 한 문단 → 안내 사항(일시·장소·대상·준비물) → 유의 사항 → 문의처 → 날짜 → 발신 명의 |
| 공문 (official letter) | 수신 → (경유) → 제목 → `1. 관련: …` → `2.` 본문 → `붙임  1. ○○ 1부.  끝.` |
| 회의록 (minutes) | 회의명 → 일시·장소·참석자(표) → 안건 → 논의 내용 → 결정 사항 → 향후 일정(담당·기한은 표) |
| 제안서 (proposal) | 제목 → 제안 배경 → 제안 내용 → 추진 방법·일정 → 소요 예산 → 기대 효과 |

Leave out a part the material has nothing for; never pad one. A document in another language keeps the same tools and follows that language's own conventions (numbered headings, full sentences).

## 3. Write in the document register

- **Title:** a short noun phrase naming the matter, with no sentence ending: `2026년 상반기 직원 연수 운영 계획`, `○○ 사업 추진 결과 보고`.
- **One sentence style per document.** 개조식 ends lines in nouns or `~함`, `~임`, `~예정`; 서술식 ends in `~합니다`, `~바랍니다`. Do not mix them at the same level.
- **Level marks are typed as text, one scheme for the whole document:** `□ → ○ → - → ·`, or `1. → 가. → 1) → 가) → (1) → (가) → ①`. Never skip a level, never use two marks at one depth. Do not indent with spaces: each level takes its indent from its paragraph style (section 4).
- **One line says one thing.** Three or more parallel items that each have two or more attributes (who, when, how much) become a table, not a long line.
- **Dates and figures:** `2026. 11. 11.(수)`, `14:00~16:00`, `1,200천원`, with the unit named. Every figure comes from the material; a value you do not have is written `○○` and listed in your reply.
- **Emphasis is rare:** bold for the title and the part headings only, unless the user asks for more.

## 4. Build it in this order

1. **Columns first, when the document has them** (a test paper, a newsletter): `set_columns`. Most documents have one column and skip this step.
2. **All the text.** Put the title and every part into the document with `insert_paragraphs` (where "end" on an empty document), in as few calls as possible: one call takes up to 100 paragraphs and each paragraph is one line. Leave out empty lines between parts: the space above a heading comes from its style in step 4.
3. **Tables after the text.** Write a caption line above the place (`<표 1> 세부 추진 일정`), then `insert_table` with that line as the anchor, where "after" and a header row, in the look the document has (a grid, or open at the sides, with the header row in the accent colour). Keep to six columns or fewer on a portrait page, name units in the header row, and keep each cell to a short phrase. Then call `check_layout`; if a cell overflows, shorten its text.
4. **The look, in a few calls, for the text you wrote in this request.** A run of default text is not a finished document: give it the look that kind of document has, as the editor's own instructions on the look of a document describe. One `style_paragraphs` call makes a paragraph style for each level (part heading, item, sub-item, note; a heading style keeps its line with the text after it) and applies each by the mark or the number its lines start with, and the title by its text. Then `insert_title_box` for the title of a report or a plan; a notice takes a centred title, and an official letter takes neither a box nor colour. Then `read_page_layout`, and `set_page_number` when the document runs over one page. Do not format paragraph by paragraph, and leave alone text that was in the document before this request.
5. **Extras only when the user wants them:** for a document of about five pages or more, offer a table of contents in your reply and add it with `insert_toc` only on a yes; use `insert_note` for a source the text cites when the user asked for sources; write a header or a footer with `set_header_footer` only when asked. Change the page setup only when the user asks.

## 5. What the tools make, and what they cannot

Make these with the tools instead of imitating them: a title box, tables with their border lines and shading, a box or a line of a paragraph (a border in `format_paragraph` or in a style: a box round a summary, a line under a heading), an approval box (결재란: a small table at the right, made with `insert_table`, `merge_cells` and `format_cells`), page numbers, a header or footer of one line, columns, a page or column break (`insert_break`), a line round the page of a certificate (`set_page_border`), a leader of dots up to a page number or a time (tab stops), and formulas (`insert_equations`). Never fake one: no 1×1 table typed as a box by hand, no line drawn with repeated `─` characters, no page number typed at the bottom, no dots typed up to a number.

The tools cannot draw a line between columns, put a table or a picture into a header or footer, draw shapes or text boxes, or move or replace a picture that is already in the document. Say that the user adds these in the editor.

## 6. Check before you answer (required)

Read the document once with `read_document` and go through this list. Fix what fails, then answer.

- Every planned part is there, in order, and none appears twice.
- Level marks follow one scheme with no skipped level; lines at the same depth have the same style.
- One sentence style throughout.
- No markdown left in the text (`#`, `**`, table pipes), and no spaces typed as an indent.
- Every date, name and figure is in the user's material; each `○○` is listed in your reply.
- Each table has a caption line above it and a header row, and `check_layout` reports no overflow.

In your reply say in a few lines what you wrote (the parts and roughly how many pages), which look you gave it and which fonts stood in for ones this PC lacks, what you assumed, which `○○` places are left and what belongs in each, and what the user still has to add by hand, if anything.
